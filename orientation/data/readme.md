I ran the first run, which contains orientation with sigma = 1e-2

## Aug 8

I pulled new orientation data after it had run and decided to use sigma = 1e-5 instead. I generated plots comparing the marginal PPDs and correlations (corner plots) in `corner-compare.png`, but these aren't super useful except in that the correlations are not too strong, which is also true of the angular velocity case. So I showed only the marginal ppds in a smaller plot called `unc-compare.png`. Results are as expected, so I can close off this part of the project.
